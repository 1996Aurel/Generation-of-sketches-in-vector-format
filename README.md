## Requirements: 

- python >= 3.7.10
- librairies: numpy, torch, torchvision, matplotlib, PIL, _pickle, os, math

## Description: 

In this project, we tried to extend the generation of images in vector format to various classes of images. We implemented a Pytorch version of Sketch-RNN, where we trained a neural network on how to draw like a human on the data set of sketches generated by humans "Quick, Draw!". 

__Models:__

- Single class of images: 

Our Pytorch version of Sketch-RNN was initially trained with a single class of images, which allowed us to better explore the role of W<sub>KL;<\sub> in the loss function:  Loss = L<sub>R<\sub> + W<sub>KL<\sub> Â· L<sub>KL<\sub>
